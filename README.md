# Fracture Detection 
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model for fracture detection in X-ray images using ResNet50. The current model classifies images as "Fractured" or "Non-fractured." However, the model's performance is below expectations, indicating the need for further optimization, including better data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning. Future work involves enhancing the model for multi-class fracture classification, enabling it to detect specific types of fractures. Additionally, incorporating a localization mechanism to draw bounding boxes around the detected fractures will improve the model's utility in medical diagnostics, providing precise visual feedback for healthcare professionals.
